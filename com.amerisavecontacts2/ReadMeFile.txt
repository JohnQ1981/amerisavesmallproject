CONTACTS Projects

In this small Project I have used Spring Boot Framework, and utilized Spring Boot MVC Design Pattern, where we have Control class, Data Access Layer, Repository Layer and Service Layer.
First we have to make sure we have Entity package with Entity Class (pojo/bean class that has all getters and setter and to string method) that creates Table in Database, in my case used MySQL Database.
Of course before all that , we have to make sure all dependencies are added in pom.xml files and we have saved and updated the project and make sure we have all connection string and all other necessary settings set in application.properties file.
Please update user name and password for the database that is going to be used.
And check the connection string for the datasource.url

I have used MySQL, and I have implemented Spring Boot MVC Design pattern, where there is a Model Class, Controller Layer and Service Layer, Data Access Layer and Implementation layer. 
Controller Class has all methods to be implemented. Where Repository interface extends to JPARepository to perform all CRUD operations. 
Service Interface has all methods that Service implementation is overriding.
And of Course, Entity Class is used by hibernate to create Table in MySQL Database. 
 Basically I tried to implement 4 Basic Properties of OOP. Inheritance, Abstraction, Polymorphism and Encapsulation. 
Of course Dynamic polymorphism is being used, since static is methods overloading which I did not use in this project. 
Spring Boot Offers Notations that makes developerâ€™s life easier, by injection upon running the classes and objects being created. Dependency injection is main feature of Spring Boot. 
Should you have any questions please let me know.
Sincerely,
John Qosimi
